==============================================================================
 1. INTRODUCTION                                           *SearchParty-intro*

SearchParty provides extended search tools for Vim, such as searching for the
current visual selection (forwards and backwards), using the current visual
selection in a |:substitute|, performing literal (non regex) searches and
controlling current search highlight.

==============================================================================
 2. USAGE                                                  *SearchParty-usage*

Note: All of the default maps shown below can be overridden using the <Plug>
maps given.

Visual Searches~

SearchParty provides three visual mode search tools:

  *	Searches for the next occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
	<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindNext

  #	Searches for the prior occurrence of the currently selected visual text.
	<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindPrior

  &	Starts a |:substitute| using the currently selected visual text.
	<Plug>SearchPartyVisualFindSubstitute

Literal Search~

SearchParty provides a normal mode literal text (without regular expression
magic) search:

  <leader>/  Prompts for a literal string to search for. This does NOT
             use a regular expression, so the characters you type here will be
             searched for literally without any magic interpretation.  The
             |<Up>| key scrolls through prior literal search history.
             <Plug>SearchPartyFindLiteral

Search Highlighting~

SearchParty provides three normal mode search highlight tools:

  <C-L>      Temporarily clears search highlight.
             <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightClear


  <C-BSlash> Toggles search highlighting.
             <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightToggle

  <leader>*  Highlights all occurrences of |word| under the cursor.
             <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightWord


  <leader>g* Highlights all occurrences of |WORD| under the cursor.
             <Plug>SearchPartyHighlightWORD

Pattern Searches~

  <leader>ms Prompts for a pattern and sets the current search to that pattern
             without moving the cursor to the next match of that pattern.
             <Plug>SearchPartySetSearch

Matches~

  <leader>mm Prompts for a pattern and uses |matchadd()| to highlight all
             occurrences of that pattern in the current window.
             <Plug>SearchPartySetMatch

             There are six match patterns available, called SPM1-SPM6
             respectively. Using more than six matches will recycle through
             the SPM set, losing the previous match assigned to that slot.

             By default, the terminal palette colours #1-#6 are used for
             SPM1-SPM6. You can override these by providing lines like this in
             your ~/.vimrc file:
>
               hi SPM1 ctermbg=123
<
             NOTE: Do this after you have set your colorscheme.

                               *SearchPartyMatchDelete* *SearchPartyMatchList*
                                                    *SearchPartyMatchNumber*
             The following functions and commands are available for Search
             Party matches:
             * SearchPartyMatchDelete(number) - clear match by number
             * SearchPartyMatchList - list all match patterns
             * SearchPartyMatchNumber(number) - reset match number (1-6)
